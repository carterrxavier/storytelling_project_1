Storytelling Project Specifications Scenario: 
You’re working as a Data Scientist at a Telecommunications company and the VP of Operations comes to you and says,
“We need to reduce customer attrition! Our customers are leaving us for competitors at way too high a rate.
Our VP of Sales says removing the month-to-month plan is NOT an option. 
I already know those customers leave the most, so I want you to focus on only the customers on the Month-to-Month plan.
What do you think is driving them to churn? What can we do to try to keep these customers from leaving?”

Business Goal: Reduce customer attrition, a.k.a. Churn, among the customers on the month-to-month plan.
Why? Because keeping customers is cheaper than getting new customers.
